#+TITLE: Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Ryan Jeffrey

My dotfiles. My current setup is based on Arch Linux (which I use, btw), zsh for my shell, emacs as my text editor/userland replacement, and bspwm as my WM.

I recommend symlinking the files to their proper place in order to use them: 

#+begin_src shell
# From this repo's directory
ln -s $(pwd)/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
ln -s $(pwd)/.config ~/.config
#+end_src

..for example.

Some of the files, such as the crontabs, need to be installed manually.

* .zshrc
~.config/zsh~. This needs to be symlinked to ~~/.zshrc.~ Remember to change the pathnames depending on the username (ie /home/<name>).
* Emacs
~init.el~ loads ~lisp/config.org~, which contains most of the configuration. My email and RSS configs are private.
