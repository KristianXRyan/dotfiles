#+TITLE: Dotfiles
#+AUTHOR: Ryan Jeffrey

My dotfiles. The current programs I use are zsh for my shell,
emacs as my text editor, and i3 as my WM.

* .zshrc
Uses oh-my-zsh
* Emacs
.emacs loads the file called .econfig.org. Both of the 
config.org files are smiliar files, but for different
configurations.
* i3
.config/i3/config and .config/i3bar/config.
