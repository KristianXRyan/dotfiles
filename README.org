#+TITLE: Dotfiles

My dotfiles. The current programs I have are Arch Linux (which I use, btw), zsh for my shell,
emacs as my text editor/userland replacement, and dwm as my WM.

* .zshrc
.zshrc. Uses oh-my-zsh. Remember to change the pathnames depending on the username (ie /home/<name>)
* Emacs
.emacs loads the file called .econfig.org. The file in this repo called .econfig.org is for my Thinkpad as it is the main computer I use. 
The speconf.org file is the configuration for emacs on my desktop. It is stripped down with fewer features. Rename to .econfig.org to use it.
* dwm
Look for my fork of dwm.
